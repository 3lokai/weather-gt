# E7-02 (P0) Deep Links & Share

## Description
URLs encode `lat,lon,name,units,timeFormat,dayIndex`; "Copy link" button integrated into current weather card.

## Acceptance Criteria

* ✅ Loading a deep link restores exact state.
* ✅ Share button integrated into current weather card header.
* ✅ Copy link functionality works on mobile and desktop.
* ✅ URL updates automatically when location or settings change.

## Dependencies
Routing.

## Priority
P0 (Must have for demo)

## Definition of Done
- [x] Accessibility: Keyboard + visible focus + ARIA patterns; AA contrast
- [x] Performance: No unexpected layout shift; cached where applicable
- [x] Testing: Unit for mappers/formatters; component tests for deep links; E2E happy path
- [ ] Docs: README + changelog updated; component props documented

## Technical Notes
- ✅ Implement URL state management for all app state
- ✅ Encode location (lat, lon, name), units, time format, and selected day index in URL
- ✅ Add share button to current weather card header (top-right corner)
- ✅ Ensure loading a deep link restores exact app state
- ✅ Handle URL updates when user changes settings or location
- ✅ Implement proper URL encoding/decoding
- ✅ Add share functionality for mobile devices (Web Share API fallback to copy)
- ✅ Ensure deep links work with browser back/forward navigation
- ✅ Add proper error handling for invalid URLs
- ✅ Share button shows toast confirmation on successful copy

## Implementation Details

### URL State Management
- Created `src/lib/utils/url-state.ts` with encoding/decoding utilities
- Implemented `src/hooks/use-url-state.ts` for URL synchronization
- URL parameters: `lat`, `lon`, `name`, `temp`, `wind`, `precip`, `pressure`, `time`, `day`

### Share Functionality
- Created `src/lib/utils/share.ts` with Web Share API + clipboard fallback
- Implemented `src/hooks/use-weather-share.ts` for weather-specific sharing
- Uses shadcn sonner for toast notifications
- Supports both mobile (Web Share API) and desktop (clipboard) sharing

### Integration
- Share button added to current weather card header (top-right corner)
- URL state automatically syncs with weather store changes
- Deep links restore exact app state on page load
- Browser back/forward navigation works with URL state
