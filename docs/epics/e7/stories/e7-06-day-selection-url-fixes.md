# E7-06 (P0) Day Selection & URL State Fixes

## Description
Critical bug fixes for day selection functionality and URL state management interference issues.

## Acceptance Criteria

* ✅ Day selection in seven-day forecast rail updates all metrics and cards
* ✅ URL state management does not interfere with user interactions
* ✅ Location changes work properly without URL state conflicts
* ✅ Date parameter included in URLs for proper deep linking
* ✅ All components use consistent data structure mapping

## Dependencies
E1-04 (7-Day Forecast Rail), E7-02 (Deep Links & Share)

## Priority
P0 (Critical bug fixes for core functionality)

## Definition of Done
- [x] Accessibility: Keyboard + visible focus + ARIA patterns; AA contrast
- [x] Performance: No unexpected layout shift; cached where applicable
- [x] Testing: Unit for mappers/formatters; component tests for day selection; E2E happy path
- [x] Docs: README + changelog updated; component props documented

## Story

As a **user**,
I want **day selection to work properly and URL state to not interfere with my interactions**,
so that **I can navigate between days and share links without issues**.

## Context

This story addresses critical bugs discovered in the day selection functionality and URL state management. While the original stories (E1-04 and E7-02) were marked as completed, they had underlying issues that prevented proper functionality:

1. **Day Selection Issues**: Clicking on days in the forecast rail wasn't updating all components due to incorrect data structure mapping
2. **URL State Interference**: URL state management was overriding user interactions, preventing both day selection and location changes
3. **Missing Date in URLs**: URLs only included day index but not actual dates, making deep links unreliable

## Dev Notes

### Technical Implementation

**Data Structure Mapping Fixes:**
- Created `src/lib/utils/weather-data-mapping.ts` with comprehensive mapping utilities
- Fixed API data structure understanding (2 past days + 7 future days = 9 total days)
- Updated all components to use consistent data mapping functions
- Added proper index mapping between UI day index and API data structure

**URL State Management Improvements:**
- Simplified URL state hook to be non-intrusive
- Only restore state from URL on initial page load
- Removed automatic URL updates that were causing conflicts
- Added date parameter to URLs for better deep linking
- Created URLStateProvider to handle React hooks rules

**Component Updates:**
- Fixed HourlyPanelChart to properly filter hourly data based on selected day
- Updated MetricsGrid to handle daily data for selected day correctly
- Fixed RealWeatherConditions to use correct daily data mapping
- All components now use centralized mapping utilities

### Integration Points
- Connects with existing seven-day forecast rail (E1-04)
- Integrates with URL state management (E7-02)
- Uses existing weather store and data providers
- Maintains compatibility with all existing components
