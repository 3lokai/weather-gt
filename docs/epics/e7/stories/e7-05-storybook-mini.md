# E7-05: Storybook Review & Regression

## Status: Draft

## Story

As a **developer and designer**,
I want **comprehensive Storybook review and regression testing**,
so that **all components are properly documented, accessible, and ready for production with visual regression protection**.

## Context

This story represents the final review and hardening phase for Storybook. It ensures all components have proper documentation, accessibility compliance, and visual regression testing.

  - [ ] Prepare Storybook for stakeholder review

## Dev Notes

### Component Coverage Matrix

**P0 Components (Must Have Complete Stories):**
- CurrentConditionsCard (day/night + all major WMO groups)
- MetricTile (feels-like, humidity, wind+gust, precip+PoP, pressure+trend, UV, visibility, cloud, dew)
- DailyChip (hi/low, icon, PoP; selected/hover/focus)
- HourlyRow + HourlyPanel (list + chart; loading/empty/error)
- UnitsDropdown (menu with "Switch to …" + grouped checks)
- LocationSearch (empty, results, keyboard focus, error)
- ErrorState & Skeletons (match provided comps)

**P1 Components (Should Have Basic Stories):**
- FavoritesDrawer (empty, 1–N items, reorder)
- CompareCard (2–4 cards grid, linked-hover demo)
- SunCycle (progress variants)
- RiveHero (reduced-motion off/on; clear/rain/thunder)

### Story Requirements

**Each component story must cover:**
- Themes: light, dark, and condition accent (.theme--rain|cloudy|snow|thunder)
- Viewports: mobile, tablet, desktop
- States: default, loading, empty, error, disabled
- Units/time: metric/imperial, 12/24-h
- Accessibility: focus-visible, high-contrast, reduced motion
- At least 2 WMO weather condition examples

### Visual Regression Testing

**Screenshot Coverage:**
- All component states across all themes
- All viewport sizes for responsive components
- All weather condition variants
- All interaction states (hover, focus, active)
- Error and loading states

### Accessibility Standards

**WCAG AA Compliance:**
- Color contrast ratios ≥ 4.5:1 for normal text
- Color contrast ratios ≥ 3:1 for large text
- Keyboard navigation for all interactive elements
- Focus indicators visible and consistent
- ARIA labels and roles properly implemented

## Testing

### Accessibility Testing
- [ ] @storybook/addon-a11y reports no critical violations
- [ ] Manual keyboard navigation testing
- [ ] Screen reader compatibility testing
- [ ] High contrast mode testing
- [ ] Focus management testing

### Visual Regression Testing
- [ ] Baseline screenshots captured
- [ ] Visual regression tests pass in CI
- [ ] Cross-browser consistency verified
- [ ] Responsive design visual testing
- [ ] Animation and transition testing

### Interactive Testing
- [ ] All user flows work correctly
- [ ] Keyboard navigation functional
- [ ] Menu and dropdown interactions
- [ ] Form validation and submission
- [ ] Animation and transition behaviors

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All P0 components have complete Storybook stories
- [ ] All P1 components have basic Storybook stories
- [ ] @storybook/addon-a11y shows no critical violations
- [ ] Visual regression testing configured and passing
- [ ] All component APIs documented with controls
- [ ] Interactive testing complete for all components
- [ ] Component gallery ready for stakeholder review
- [ ] Storybook ready for production use

## Dependencies

- **E2-04**: Storybook Foundations (must be complete)
- **E2-05**: Design Tokens & Typography Docs (must be complete)
- **E1 Components**: All component stories must be implemented
- **E2 Components**: All component stories must be implemented

## Notes

This story represents the final quality gate for Storybook. It ensures that all components are properly documented, accessible, and ready for production use. The visual regression testing will catch any unintended visual changes, while the accessibility testing ensures compliance with WCAG standards.

The component gallery will serve as the primary showcase for stakeholders and will be used for design reviews and user testing. All stories should be production-ready and accurately represent the final component behavior.
