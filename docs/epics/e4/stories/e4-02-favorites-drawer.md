## Story

As a **frequent user**,
I want **to save favorite locations and access recent searches**,
so that **I can quickly switch between my regular locations and easily re-find recently viewed places without having to search each time**.

## Context

This story implements a dual-location access system: a favorites dropdown in the header for quick access to regularly used locations, and recent searches integrated into the search experience for easy re-access to recently viewed places. The system includes local persistence, drag-and-drop reordering, and live weather data display for favorites.

## Dev Notes

### Technical Implementation

**Favorites Storage:**
- Use localStorage for persistence across sessions
- Store location objects with all necessary data (name, coordinates, timezone, etc.)
- Implement deduplication logic to prevent duplicate entries
- Add migration logic for any future schema changes

**Recent Searches Storage:**
- Store recent search history in localStorage (last 10 searches)
- Include timestamp and location data for each recent search
- Auto-cleanup old entries (older than 30 days)
- Exclude current location from recent searches

**Favorites Dropdown UI:**
- Dropdown in header next to current location display
- List of favorite locations with live weather data (temp, condition icon)
- Drag-and-drop reordering with visual feedback
- Current location shown at top if favorited
- Quick switch functionality to load location data

**Recent Searches Integration:**
- Show recent searches when search input is focused
- Display location name and last viewed timestamp
- Quick selection without typing
- "Clear Recent" option for privacy

**State Management:**
- Integrate with existing Zustand store
- Add favorites array and recentSearches array to global state
- Implement actions for add/remove/reorder favorites
- Implement actions for add/clear recent searches
- Sync with localStorage on state changes

**Integration Points:**
- Connect with search functionality (E1-01) for adding favorites and tracking recent searches
- Use existing weather data fetching for favorites display
- Integrate with location selection system
- Leverage existing toast notification system
- Replace current location display in header with favorites dropdown

### Design Considerations

**Favorites Dropdown Behavior:**
- Dropdown trigger in header next to current location
- Smooth open/close animations
- Click outside to close
- Responsive design for different screen sizes
- Mobile-friendly touch targets

**Favorites List:**
- Show location name, country, and current temperature
- Display weather condition icon for quick visual reference
- Include last updated timestamp
- Show loading states for individual favorites
- Current location highlighted at top if favorited

**Recent Searches Behavior:**
- Appear when search input is focused
- Show below search input with clear section header
- Include location name and relative timestamp ("2 hours ago")
- "Clear Recent" link at bottom of recent section
- Smooth fade-in/out animations

**Drag and Drop:**
- Visual feedback during drag operations in favorites dropdown
- Smooth reordering animations
- Touch-friendly for mobile devices
- Keyboard accessible reordering (up/down arrows)

**Star Toggle:**
- Heart icon in current weather card header (top-right corner, next to share button)
- Prominent star icon in search results and location cards
- Filled heart/star for favorited locations, outline for non-favorites
- Toast notification on add/remove actions
- Smooth transition animations

### Accessibility Requirements

**ARIA Patterns:**
- Proper labeling for favorites dropdown and recent searches
- Announcements for add/remove actions
- Status updates for drag-and-drop operations
- Clear focus management when dropdown opens/closes
- Combobox pattern for search with recent suggestions

**Keyboard Navigation:**
- Tab navigation through favorites dropdown
- Enter/Space to select favorite location
- Arrow keys for reordering favorites (up/down)
- Escape to close dropdown
- Arrow keys to navigate recent searches
- Enter to select recent search

**Screen Reader Support:**
- Descriptive labels for all interactive elements
- Status announcements for state changes
- Clear instructions for drag-and-drop operations
- Announce recent searches section when search is focused
