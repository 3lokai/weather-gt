# E4-01 (P0) Geolocation First Visit

## Description
Ask permission; load local forecast; fallback to search.

## Acceptance Criteria

* Friendly prompt; denial path emphasized; remembers choice.

## Dependencies
E1-02 (current conditions), E1-03 (metrics)

## Priority
P0 (Must have for demo)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Accessibility: Keyboard + visible focus + ARIA patterns; AA contrast
- [ ] Performance: No unexpected layout shift; cached where applicable
- [ ] Testing: Unit for mappers/formatters; component tests for geolocation; E2E happy path
- [ ] Docs: README + changelog updated; component props documented

## Story

As a **first-time user**,
I want **the app to automatically detect my location and show my local weather**,
so that **I can immediately see relevant weather information without having to search**.

## Context

This story implements the geolocation-first experience for new users, providing a seamless onboarding flow that automatically detects their location and loads the local weather forecast. The implementation must handle permission requests gracefully and provide clear fallback options.

## Dev Notes

### Technical Implementation

**Geolocation API Integration:**
- Use `navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition()` with proper error handling
- Implement timeout and fallback mechanisms
- Store user's location preference in localStorage/sessionStorage
- Handle permission denied scenarios gracefully

**User Experience Flow:**
1. On first visit, show friendly geolocation permission prompt
2. If granted, automatically load weather for user's location
3. If denied, show search interface with helpful messaging
4. Remember user's choice for future visits

**Integration Points:**
- Connect with existing search functionality (E1-01)
- Use current conditions display (E1-02)
- Integrate with metrics grid (E1-03)
- Leverage existing error handling patterns

**State Management:**
- Track geolocation permission status
- Store user's location coordinates
- Manage loading states during geolocation request
- Handle offline scenarios

### Design Considerations

**Permission Prompt:**
- Clear, friendly messaging explaining why location is needed
- Emphasize benefits (local weather, personalized experience)
- Provide easy opt-out option
- Follow platform conventions for permission requests

**Fallback Experience:**
- If permission denied, gracefully transition to search
- Show helpful messaging about manual location entry
- Maintain positive user experience regardless of choice

**Loading States:**
- Show appropriate loading indicators during geolocation
- Handle timeout scenarios (10-15 seconds)
- Provide cancel option for long-running requests

### Accessibility Requirements

**ARIA Patterns:**
- Proper labeling for permission prompts
- Status announcements for geolocation progress
- Clear focus management during state transitions

**Keyboard Navigation:**
- All interactive elements must be keyboard accessible
- Logical tab order through permission flow
- Clear focus indicators

**Screen Reader Support:**
- Descriptive text for geolocation status
- Clear instructions for permission decisions
- Status updates during location detection

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] **Task 1: Geolocation Service Implementation**
  - [ ] Create geolocation utility service with error handling
  - [ ] Implement permission request logic with user-friendly messaging
  - [ ] Add timeout and fallback mechanisms
  - [ ] Handle browser compatibility and feature detection

- [ ] **Task 2: Permission Prompt Component**
  - [ ] Design and implement geolocation permission prompt UI
  - [ ] Add clear messaging about benefits and privacy
  - [ ] Implement accept/deny actions with proper state management
  - [ ] Add accessibility features (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)

- [ ] **Task 3: Location State Management**
  - [ ] Integrate geolocation with existing weather data fetching
  - [ ] Implement location storage and retrieval
  - [ ] Add loading states for geolocation requests
  - [ ] Handle offline scenarios and network errors

- [ ] **Task 4: Fallback Experience**
  - [ ] Implement graceful fallback to search interface
  - [ ] Add helpful messaging for permission denied scenarios
  - [ ] Ensure smooth transition between geolocation and search flows
  - [ ] Test edge cases (timeout, network errors, browser restrictions)

- [ ] **Task 5: Integration and Testing**
  - [ ] Integrate with existing weather components (E1-02, E1-03)
  - [ ] Add unit tests for geolocation service
  - [ ] Implement component tests for permission prompt
  - [ ] Add E2E tests for complete geolocation flow
  - [ ] Test accessibility with screen readers and keyboard navigation
