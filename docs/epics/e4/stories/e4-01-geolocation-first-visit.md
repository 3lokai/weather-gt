## Story

As a **first-time user**,
I want **the app to automatically detect my location and show my local weather**,
so that **I can immediately see relevant weather information without having to search**.

## Context

This story implements the geolocation-first experience for new users, providing a seamless onboarding flow that automatically detects their location and loads the local weather forecast. The implementation must handle permission requests gracefully and provide clear fallback options.

## Dev Notes

### Technical Implementation

**Geolocation API Integration:**
- Use `navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition()` with proper error handling
- Implement timeout and fallback mechanisms
- Store user's location preference in localStorage/sessionStorage
- Handle permission denied scenarios gracefully

**User Experience Flow:**
1. On first visit, show friendly geolocation permission prompt
2. If granted, automatically load weather for user's location
3. If denied, show search interface with helpful messaging
4. Remember user's choice for future visits

**Integration Points:**
- Connect with existing search functionality (E1-01)
- Use current conditions display (E1-02)
- Integrate with metrics grid (E1-03)
- Leverage existing error handling patterns

**State Management:**
- Track geolocation permission status
- Store user's location coordinates
- Manage loading states during geolocation request
- Handle offline scenarios

### Design Considerations

**Permission Prompt:**
- Clear, friendly messaging explaining why location is needed
- Emphasize benefits (local weather, personalized experience)
- Provide easy opt-out option
- Follow platform conventions for permission requests

**Fallback Experience:**
- If permission denied, gracefully transition to search
- Show helpful messaging about manual location entry
- Maintain positive user experience regardless of choice

**Loading States:**
- Show appropriate loading indicators during geolocation
- Handle timeout scenarios (10-15 seconds)
- Provide cancel option for long-running requests

### Accessibility Requirements

**ARIA Patterns:**
- Proper labeling for permission prompts
- Status announcements for geolocation progress
- Clear focus management during state transitions

**Keyboard Navigation:**
- All interactive elements must be keyboard accessible
- Logical tab order through permission flow
- Clear focus indicators

**Screen Reader Support:**
- Descriptive text for geolocation status
- Clear instructions for permission decisions
- Status updates during location detection
