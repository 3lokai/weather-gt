- [ ] Testing: Component tests for layout; E2E happy path
- [ ] Docs: README + changelog updated; component props documented

## Story

As a **user visiting the weather app**,
I want **to see a clean, focused home page that matches the design specifications**,
so that **I can quickly understand the current weather and access forecast information without being overwhelmed by demo content**.

## Context

The current home page contains many demo sections and test components that were useful during development but need to be replaced with the actual production layout. The design specifications show a clean, focused layout with:

1. **Header**: Logo, location display, settings dropdown, theme toggle
2. **Hero Section**: Main question, search bar, subtitle
3. **Current Weather Card**: Large card with location, date, weather icon, and temperature
4. **Metrics Grid**: 2x2 grid showing feels like, humidity, wind, precipitation
5. **Daily Forecast**: Horizontal scrollable strip of 7-day forecast
6. **Hourly Forecast**: Right sidebar (desktop) or full-width section (mobile) with hourly details

## Dev Notes

### Design Analysis

**Desktop Layout (from design mockup):**
- Three-column layout with main content on left, hourly forecast on right
- Current weather card is prominent with gradient background
- Metrics grid is 2x2 below the main weather card
- Daily forecast is horizontal scrollable strip
- Hourly forecast is in right sidebar with day selector

**Mobile Layout (from design mockup):**
- Single column layout with all sections stacked vertically
- Same components but optimized for mobile viewing
- Hourly forecast becomes full-width section below daily forecast

### Technical Implementation

**Layout Structure:**
- Use CSS Grid for desktop three-column layout
- Use Flexbox for mobile single-column layout
- Implement responsive breakpoints for smooth transitions
- Ensure proper spacing and alignment according to design system

**Component Integration:**
- Replace demo components with production versions
- Use existing `RealWeatherConditions` component for current weather
- Integrate `MetricsGrid` component for weather metrics
- Use `SevenDayForecast` component for daily forecast
- Use `HourlyPanel` component for hourly forecast
- Maintain existing search and geolocation functionality

**Responsive Design:**
- Desktop: Three-column layout (main content + hourly sidebar)
- Tablet: Two-column layout (main content + hourly below)
- Mobile: Single-column layout with all sections stacked

### Design System Compliance

**Typography:**
- Use established typography scale from design system
- Maintain proper hierarchy with display, heading, and body text
- Ensure consistent spacing between elements

**Colors and Theming:**
- Use established color tokens from design system
- Maintain glass morphism effects for cards
- Ensure proper contrast ratios for accessibility

**Spacing and Layout:**
- Use consistent spacing scale from design system
- Maintain proper component margins and padding
- Ensure responsive spacing that scales appropriately

### Component Mapping

**Current Components to Use:**
- `RealWeatherConditions` → Current weather card
- `MetricsGrid` → Weather metrics grid
- `SevenDayForecast` → Daily forecast strip
- `HourlyPanel` → Hourly forecast section
- `InlineSearch` → Search functionality
- `SettingsDropdown` → Settings menu
- `ThemeToggle` → Theme switching

**Layout Components to Create:**
- `HomePageLayout` → Main layout wrapper
- `WeatherHero` → Hero section with search
- `WeatherContent` → Main weather content area
- `WeatherSidebar` → Hourly forecast sidebar (desktop)
