# E4-05 (P1) Current Weather Card Redesign

## Description
Redesign current weather card with prominent location/date/time on left and weather visual/temperature on right, plus action buttons in top-right corner. Clean up existing card code and remove unused variants.

## Acceptance Criteria

* Location name, date, and time displayed prominently on the left side
* Lottie animation and temperature displayed on the right side
* Heart (favorites) and share buttons in top-right corner
* Improved visual hierarchy and information flow
* Responsive design for mobile and desktop
* Maintains all existing functionality
* Cleaned up card code with removed unused variants and props
* Simplified component API

## Dependencies
E4-02 (Favorites), E7-02 (Share functionality)

## Priority
P1 (Important for user experience)

## Definition of Done
- [x] Accessibility: Proper heading structure, ARIA labels, keyboard navigation
- [x] Performance: No layout shift, smooth animations
- [x] Testing: Visual regression tests, responsive design tests
- [x] Docs: Component documentation updated

## Story

As a **weather app user**,
I want **a clearly organized current weather card with prominent location and time information**,
so that **I can quickly understand where I am and what time it is while seeing the current weather conditions**.

## Context

This story redesigns the current weather card to improve information hierarchy and visual flow. The new layout emphasizes location and time information on the left while keeping weather visuals and temperature prominent on the right. Action buttons (favorites and share) are positioned in the top-right corner for easy access. As part of this redesign, we'll also clean up the existing card code by removing unused size variants, props, and simplifying the component API.

## Technical Notes

**New Card Layout:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ [❤️] [📤]                                    │
│                                                     │
│ Location Name, Country        [Lottie]  Temperature │
│ Date, Time                    [Condition]           │
│                                                     │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Layout Structure:**
- **Left Side**: Location name, country, current date, current time
- **Right Side**: Lottie weather animation, temperature, condition text
- **Top-Right**: Heart icon (favorites), Share icon
- **Responsive**: Stack vertically on mobile, side-by-side on desktop

**Typography Hierarchy:**
- Location name: Large, bold heading
- Date/Time: Medium size, secondary color
- Temperature: Large, prominent
- Condition: Medium size, descriptive

**Code Cleanup:**
- Remove unused size variants (sm, md, lg) - keep only default
- Remove unused layout props and options
- Simplify component props interface
- Remove dead code and unused imports
- Consolidate similar functionality

**Integration Points:**
- Connect with favorites system (E4-02) for heart icon
- Connect with share system (E7-02) for share icon
- Use existing time formatting utilities
- Maintain current weather data structure
