# E4-03 (P1) Compare Grid

## Description
2–4 locations in responsive grid; linked hover on sparklines.

## Acceptance Criteria

* Each card shows current, mini 7‑day hi/lo, PoP; hover syncs time index.

## Dependencies
E1-04 (daily forecast), E1-05 (hourly data), charts

## Priority
P1 (Strongly desired)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Accessibility: Keyboard + visible focus + ARIA patterns; AA contrast
- [ ] Performance: No unexpected layout shift; cached where applicable
- [ ] Testing: Unit for mappers/formatters; component tests for comparison; E2E happy path
- [ ] Docs: README + changelog updated; component props documented

## Story

As a **user planning travel or comparing locations**,
I want **to see multiple locations side-by-side with synchronized weather data**,
so that **I can easily compare weather conditions across different places and make informed decisions**.

## Context

This story implements a location comparison feature that displays 2-4 locations in a responsive grid layout. Each location card shows current conditions, a mini 7-day forecast, and precipitation probability. The feature includes synchronized hover interactions on sparklines to compare data across locations at the same time index.

## Dev Notes

### Technical Implementation

**Comparison Grid Layout:**
- Responsive grid that adapts from 1-4 columns based on screen size
- Consistent card sizing with proper spacing
- Mobile-first design with stacked layout on small screens
- Smooth transitions when adding/removing locations

**Location Cards:**
- Current weather conditions (temperature, condition, icon)
- Mini 7-day forecast with high/low temperatures
- Precipitation probability indicators
- Location name and country
- Quick action buttons (favorite, remove from comparison)

**Synchronized Interactions:**
- Hover over sparklines syncs time index across all cards
- Visual feedback showing which time period is being compared
- Smooth animations for synchronized data updates
- Touch-friendly interactions for mobile devices

**Data Management:**
- Fetch weather data for multiple locations in parallel
- Use existing daily forecast (E1-04) and hourly data (E1-05) components
- Implement efficient caching for comparison data
- Handle loading states for individual locations

**Integration Points:**
- Connect with favorites system for quick location selection
- Use existing search functionality to add locations
- Leverage existing chart components for sparklines
- Integrate with weather data fetching system

### Design Considerations

**Grid Responsiveness:**
- 4 columns on desktop (xl screens)
- 3 columns on large tablets (lg screens)
- 2 columns on small tablets (md screens)
- 1 column on mobile (sm screens)
- Consistent card aspect ratios across all sizes

**Card Content:**
- Prominent current temperature and condition
- Compact 7-day forecast with essential data
- Clear precipitation probability indicators
- Subtle location identification
- Consistent visual hierarchy

**Synchronized Hover:**
- Highlighted time index across all cards
- Smooth transitions between time periods
- Clear visual connection between cards
- Accessible alternative for keyboard users

**Performance Optimization:**
- Lazy load comparison data
- Efficient re-rendering on hover interactions
- Debounced hover events to prevent excessive updates
- Optimized chart rendering for multiple locations

### Accessibility Requirements

**ARIA Patterns:**
- Proper labeling for comparison grid
- Announcements for synchronized interactions
- Clear identification of compared locations
- Status updates for data loading

**Keyboard Navigation:**
- Tab navigation through location cards
- Arrow keys for time index navigation
- Enter/Space for location selection
- Clear focus indicators

**Screen Reader Support:**
- Descriptive labels for all data points
- Clear comparison context
- Instructions for synchronized interactions
- Alternative text for weather icons
