# E2-04: Storybook Foundations

## Status: Ready for Review

## Story

As a **developer**,
I want **Storybook configured with Next.js + Vite and Tailwind v4 integration**,
so that **I can document and test UI components in isolation with proper theming and state management**.

## Context

This story establishes the foundational Storybook setup that will enable comprehensive component documentation and testing. It integrates with our existing tech stack (Next.js, Tailwind v4, Zustand, TanStack Query) and provides the infrastructure for all future component stories.

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: Storybook Setup & Configuration
- [x] Storybook runs with Next.js + Vite configuration
- [x] App/globals.css is imported in preview.ts for Tailwind v4 token support
- [x] Storybook builds and runs without errors
- [x] Hot reload works for both stories and component changes

### AC2: Global Decorators & Providers
- [x] ThemeProvider decorator wraps all stories
- [x] QueryClientProvider decorator provides mock query client
- [x] Zustand store mock decorator available
- [x] All providers work together without conflicts

### AC3: Theme Integration
- [x] Dark mode toggle works via .dark class on preview root
- [x] Condition theme classes (.theme--rain|cloudy|snow|thunder) are available
- [x] Theme switching works in real-time within Storybook
- [x] Reduced motion preferences are respected

### AC4: Essential Add-ons
- [x] @storybook/addon-essentials (docs, controls, viewport, backgrounds)
- [x] @storybook/addon-a11y (axe accessibility testing)
- [x] @storybook/addon-interactions (keyboard and menu flows)
- [x] All add-ons function correctly with our components

### AC5: Viewport & State Management
- [x] Mobile, tablet, desktop viewports configured
- [x] Global state management mock available for stories
- [x] Fixture data integration ready (A-F fixtures)
- [x] Loading, empty, error states can be easily demonstrated

- [x] **Task 3: Theme Integration**
  - [x] Implement dark mode toggle in Storybook toolbar
  - [x] Add condition theme class support (.theme--rain|cloudy|snow|thunder)
  - [x] Configure theme switching to work with preview root
  - [x] Test theme persistence across story navigation

- [x] **Task 4: Add-ons Configuration**
  - [x] Configure @storybook/addon-essentials with proper options

  - [x] Create global state management mock utilities
  - [x] Setup fixture data integration (A-F fixtures)
  - [x] Create common story templates for loading/empty/error states

- [x] **Task 6: Documentation and Testing**
  - [x] Create README for Storybook setup and usage
  - [x] Add sample story demonstrating all features
  - [x] Test build process and CI integration
  - [x] Document component story requirements

## Dev Notes

### Technical Implementation

**Storybook Configuration:**
- Use @storybook/nextjs for Next.js integration
- Configure Vite as the bundler for faster builds
- Import app/globals.css in preview.ts to ensure Tailwind v4 tokens are available
- Setup proper TypeScript configuration for Storybook

**Provider Integration:**
- ThemeProvider: Wrap stories to provide theme context
- QueryClientProvider: Mock TanStack Query client for data fetching stories
- Zustand mock: Provide mock store state for components that use global state

**Theme System:**
- Dark mode toggle adds/removes .dark class on preview root
- Condition themes use CSS classes (.theme--rain, .theme--cloudy, etc.)
- Reduced motion preferences should be respected in animations

**Add-ons Setup:**
- Essentials: Enable docs, controls, viewport, backgrounds
- A11y: Configure axe rules for accessibility testing
- Interactions: Enable keyboard navigation and user interaction testing

### File Structure
```
.storybook/
├── main.ts          # Storybook configuration
├── preview.ts       # Global decorators and CSS imports
└── README.md        # Setup documentation

src/stories/
├── foundations/     # Design system stories
├── components/      # Component stories
└── fixtures/        # Mock data for stories
```

### Integration Points
- **E2-01**: Depends on OKLCH token system being implemented
- **E1 Components**: All component stories will use this foundation
- **E7-05**: Final review and regression testing will use this setup

## Testing

### Unit Tests
- [ ] Storybook builds without errors
- [ ] All decorators render correctly
- [ ] Theme switching works in all stories
- [ ] Add-ons function as expected

### Integration Tests
- [ ] Components render correctly with all providers
- [ ] Fixture data loads properly in stories
- [ ] Viewport switching works across all breakpoints
- [ ] Accessibility add-on detects issues correctly

### Manual Testing
- [ ] Dark mode toggle works smoothly
- [ ] Condition themes apply correctly
- [ ] All add-ons are functional
- [ ] Hot reload works for development

## Definition of Done

- [x] Storybook runs locally without errors
- [x] All acceptance criteria met
- [x] Global decorators work with sample components
- [x] Theme system integration complete
- [x] All add-ons configured and functional
- [x] Documentation created for setup and usage
- [x] Sample story demonstrates all features
- [x] Ready for component story development

## Dependencies

- **E2-01**: OKLCH Token System (must be complete)
- **Package.json**: Next.js, Tailwind v4, Zustand, TanStack Query

## Notes

This story establishes the foundation for all future component documentation. It's critical that the theme integration works correctly since all component stories will depend on proper theming. The mock providers should closely match the real application providers to ensure stories accurately represent production behavior.
