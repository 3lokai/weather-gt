# E2-04 (P1) Visual Parity Pass

## Description
Match spacing scale (2/4/6/8/12/16/24/32…), radius (12/16/20/24), shadows, and heading "How's the sky looking today?".

## Acceptance Criteria

* Match spacing scale (2/4/6/8/12/16/24/32…), radius (12/16/20/24), shadows, and heading "How's the sky looking today?".

## Dependencies
E2-01, E2-02, E2-03

## Priority
P1 (Should have for demo)

## Definition of Done
- [x] Accessibility: Keyboard + visible focus + ARIA patterns; AA contrast
- [x] Performance: No unexpected layout shift; cached where applicable
- [x] Testing: Unit for mappers/formatters; component tests for visual parity; E2E happy path
- [x] Docs: README + changelog updated; component props documented

## Technical Notes
- ✅ Implemented consistent spacing scale throughout the application (2/4/6/8/12/16/24/32...)
- ✅ Applied consistent border radius values (12/16/20/24px) to all components
- ✅ Ensured shadow consistency across all elevated elements
- ✅ Added the specific heading "How's the sky looking today?" in appropriate locations
- ✅ Reviewed all components for visual consistency with design system
- ✅ Updated design system to include the specified spacing and radius values
- ✅ Created design tokens for consistent styling application
- ✅ Ensured responsive behavior maintains visual consistency
- ✅ Documented spacing and radius usage patterns
- ✅ Conducted visual consistency review across all components
- ✅ Enhanced search component with improved padding (ps-16 pe-16) and height (h-16)
- ✅ Fixed hydration mismatch issues with theme system
