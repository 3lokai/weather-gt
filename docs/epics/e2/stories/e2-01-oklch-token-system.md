## Description
CSS variables wired to Tailwind; light/dark base.

## Acceptance Criteria

## Dependencies
None

## Priority
P0 (Must have for demo)

## Definition of Done
- [x] Accessibility: Keyboard + visible focus + ARIA patterns; AA contrast
- [x] Performance: No unexpected layout shift; cached where applicable
- [x] Testing: Unit for mappers/formatters; component tests for tokens; E2E happy path (SKIPPED)
- [x] Docs: README + changelog updated; component props documented

## Status: ✅ COMPLETED
**Implementation**: Complete OKLCH token system in `src/app/globals.css` with:
- Full color system using OKLCH color space
- Light/dark theme variants
- Semantic color tokens (primary, secondary, accent, etc.)
- Typography scale and spacing system
- Weather condition themes
- Custom utilities and gradients
- AA contrast compliance

## Technical Notes
- Implement OKLCH color space for better color consistency and accessibility

- Wire tokens to Tailwind CSS configuration for seamless integration
- Establish light and dark mode base tokens
- Ensure AA contrast compliance in both light and dark modes
- Create semantic color tokens (primary, secondary, accent, etc.)
