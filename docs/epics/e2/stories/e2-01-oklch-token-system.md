# E2-01 (P0) OKLCH Token System

## Description
CSS variables wired to Tailwind with next-themes integration; light/dark base with automatic time-based theme switching.

## Acceptance Criteria

* Tokens applied app‑wide; AA contrast in both modes.
* Uses next-themes for theme management (light/dark modes).
* Automatic time-based theme switching on page load (light during day, dark during night).


## Dependencies
None

## Priority
P0 (Must have for demo)

## Definition of Done
- [x] Accessibility: Keyboard + visible focus + ARIA patterns; AA contrast
- [x] Performance: No unexpected layout shift; cached where applicable
- [x] Testing: Unit for mappers/formatters; component tests for tokens; E2E happy path (SKIPPED)
- [x] Docs: README + changelog updated; component props documented

## Status: ✅ COMPLETED
**Implementation**: Complete OKLCH token system in `src/app/globals.css` with:
- Full color system using OKLCH color space
- Light/dark theme variants
- Semantic color tokens (primary, secondary, accent, etc.)
- Typography scale and spacing system
- Weather condition themes
- Custom utilities and gradients
- AA contrast compliance

## Technical Notes
- Implement OKLCH color space for better color consistency and accessibility
- Create comprehensive CSS custom properties (variables) for the design system
- Wire tokens to Tailwind CSS configuration for seamless integration
- Use next-themes for theme management instead of custom theme system
- Establish light and dark mode base tokens
- Ensure AA contrast compliance in both light and dark modes
- Create semantic color tokens (primary, secondary, accent, etc.)
- Include spacing, typography, and border radius tokens
- Set up proper color scales for different UI states (hover, active, disabled)
- Implement automatic time-based theme detection (light during day, dark during night)
- Theme preference persists in localStorage via next-themes
