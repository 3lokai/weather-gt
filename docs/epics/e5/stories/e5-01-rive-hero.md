# E5-01 (P1) Rive Hero

## Description
State machine inputs (`isDay`, `condition`, `windNorm`, `uvNorm`, `precipNorm`, `thunder`).

## Acceptance Criteria

* Switches scenes based on weather; paused on reduced motion; fallback SVG.

## Dependencies
E2-02 (condition themes and icon map)

## Priority
P1 (Strongly desired)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Accessibility: Keyboard + visible focus + ARIA patterns; AA contrast
- [ ] Performance: No unexpected layout shift; cached where applicable
- [ ] Testing: Unit for mappers/formatters; component tests for animations; E2E happy path
- [ ] Docs: README + changelog updated; component props documented

## Story

As a **user viewing the weather app**,
I want **to see beautiful, dynamic hero animations that reflect the current weather conditions**,
so that **the app feels alive and engaging while providing visual context for the weather data**.

## Context

This story implements a Rive-based animated hero section that dynamically changes based on weather conditions. The animation uses a state machine with multiple inputs to create contextual, weather-aware visual experiences. The system includes accessibility considerations for reduced motion preferences and fallback SVG graphics.

## Dev Notes

### Technical Implementation

**Rive Animation Integration:**
- Use Rive runtime for web to load and control animations
- Implement state machine with weather-based inputs
- Create smooth transitions between different weather states
- Optimize animation files for web delivery

**State Machine Inputs:**
- `isDay`: Boolean for day/night transitions
- `condition`: Weather condition (clear, cloudy, rain, snow, etc.)
- `windNorm`: Normalized wind speed (0-1) for wind effects
- `uvNorm`: Normalized UV index (0-1) for sun intensity
- `precipNorm`: Normalized precipitation (0-1) for rain/snow intensity
- `thunder`: Boolean for thunderstorm effects

**Weather State Mapping:**
- Map weather codes to animation states
- Create smooth transitions between states
- Handle edge cases and unknown weather conditions
- Implement fallback states for missing data

**Performance Optimization:**
- Lazy load Rive animations
- Implement proper cleanup on component unmount
- Use requestAnimationFrame for smooth updates
- Optimize animation file sizes

**Accessibility Features:**
- Respect `prefers-reduced-motion` media query
- Pause animations when motion is reduced
- Provide fallback SVG graphics
- Ensure animations don't interfere with screen readers

### Design Considerations

**Animation States:**
- **Clear Day**: Bright, sunny animation with gentle movement
- **Clear Night**: Starry night with subtle moon phases
- **Cloudy**: Overcast sky with moving clouds
- **Rain**: Rain drops with appropriate intensity
- **Snow**: Snowflakes with wind effects
- **Thunderstorm**: Dramatic lightning and rain
- **Fog**: Misty, atmospheric effects

**Transition Behavior:**
- Smooth crossfades between states
- Gradual parameter changes (wind, precipitation)
- Contextual timing based on weather severity
- Maintain visual continuity during transitions

**Fallback Strategy:**
- Static SVG graphics for reduced motion
- Progressive enhancement approach
- Graceful degradation for unsupported browsers
- Loading states during animation initialization

**Responsive Design:**
- Scale animations appropriately for different screen sizes
- Optimize for mobile performance
- Maintain aspect ratios across devices
- Consider battery usage on mobile devices

### Accessibility Requirements

**Reduced Motion Support:**
- Detect `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce`
- Pause or disable animations when requested
- Provide static fallback graphics
- Maintain visual hierarchy without motion

**Screen Reader Compatibility:**
- Ensure animations don't interfere with screen readers
- Provide alternative text for animated elements
- Use `aria-hidden` for decorative animations
- Maintain focus management

**Performance Considerations:**
- Minimize CPU usage for battery life
- Provide option to disable animations
- Optimize for low-end devices
- Monitor animation performance metrics
