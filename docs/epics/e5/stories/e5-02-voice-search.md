# E5-02 (P1) Voice Search

## Description
Web Speech API; press‑and‑hold to record; release to search.

## Acceptance Criteria

* Feature‑detect; graceful fallback; permission errors handled.

## Dependencies
E1-01 (search functionality)

## Priority
P1 (Strongly desired)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Accessibility: Keyboard + visible focus + ARIA patterns; AA contrast
- [ ] Performance: No unexpected layout shift; cached where applicable
- [ ] Testing: Unit for mappers/formatters; component tests for voice search; E2E happy path
- [ ] Docs: README + changelog updated; component props documented

## Story

As a **user who prefers voice input**,
I want **to search for locations using my voice**,
so that **I can quickly find weather information without typing, especially when my hands are busy or I'm in a hands-free environment**.

## Context

This story implements voice search functionality using the Web Speech API. Users can press and hold a microphone button to record their voice, then release to process the speech and search for locations. The feature includes proper feature detection, graceful fallbacks, and comprehensive error handling for various scenarios including permission denials and API limitations.

## Dev Notes

### Technical Implementation

**Web Speech API Integration:**
- Use `webkitSpeechRecognition` or `SpeechRecognition` API
- Implement feature detection for browser compatibility
- Handle different browser implementations and limitations
- Provide graceful fallback for unsupported browsers

**Press-and-Hold Interface:**
- Touch-friendly button for mobile devices
- Visual feedback during recording (pulsing animation, recording indicator)
- Clear visual states: idle, recording, processing, error
- Accessible button with proper ARIA labels

**Speech Processing:**
- Real-time speech recognition with interim results
- Confidence scoring for recognition accuracy
- Text preprocessing and normalization
- Location name extraction and validation

**Error Handling:**
- Permission denied scenarios
- Network connectivity issues
- API rate limiting
- Unrecognized speech
- Browser compatibility issues

**Integration Points:**
- Connect with existing search functionality (E1-01)
- Use existing geocoding API for location search
- Integrate with search results display
- Maintain existing search history and suggestions

### Design Considerations

**User Interface:**
- Prominent microphone button in search interface
- Clear visual feedback for recording state
- Loading indicators during speech processing
- Error messages with actionable guidance

**Recording Experience:**
- Press-and-hold gesture for intuitive interaction
- Visual recording indicator (pulsing, waveform, etc.)
- Audio feedback for recording start/stop
- Clear instructions for first-time users

**Accessibility:**
- Keyboard alternative for voice search
- Screen reader announcements for recording states
- High contrast recording indicators
- Alternative input methods for voice-impaired users

**Performance:**
- Efficient speech recognition processing
- Minimal impact on app performance
- Proper cleanup of speech recognition resources
- Optimized for mobile battery usage

### Accessibility Requirements

**ARIA Patterns:**
- Proper labeling for microphone button
- Live region announcements for recording states
- Status updates for speech processing
- Error announcements with recovery options

**Keyboard Navigation:**
- Alternative keyboard shortcut for voice search
- Tab navigation to microphone button
- Enter/Space to activate voice search
- Escape to cancel recording

**Screen Reader Support:**
- Clear instructions for voice search usage
- Status announcements during recording
- Error messages with context
- Alternative text for visual indicators

**Motor Accessibility:**
- Large touch target for microphone button
- Alternative activation methods
- Adjustable recording sensitivity
- Voice command alternatives
