# Product Overview

## Summary

A modern, showcase‑quality **Weather Web App** powered by **Open‑Meteo** that highlights front‑end craftsmanship. Built with **Next.js + TypeScript + Tailwind + shadcn/ui + ReactBits patterns**, with optional **Rive** hero animations. Focus: silky interactions, adaptive theming, accessibility, and responsive layouts.

## Goals & Non‑Goals

### Goals

* Deliver a pixel‑tight, responsive UI demonstrating design systems, component composition, and delightful micro‑interactions.
* Fast, keyless weather data: search, current conditions, 7‑day, and hourly with day selector.
* Advanced extras: geolocation, favorites, compare locations, animated backgrounds, voice search, PWA.
* **Hackathon constraint**: Use **Open‑Meteo APIs only** for all data displayed in the hackathon build.

### Non‑Goals

* No account system or server‑side user data storage (local persistence only).
* No historical/climatology analytics beyond 7‑day.
* **Out of scope for hackathon** (can be post‑event extensions): third‑party **radar tiles**, **severe weather alerts** feeds outside Open‑Meteo, proprietary minute‑level nowcasts, push notifications.

## Target Users & Use Cases

* **Everyday users** checking current/weekly weather; save frequent places.
* **Travelers** comparing multiple cities at a glance.
* **Tech enthusiasts** who appreciate best‑in‑class UI polish.

## Success Metrics

* **Lighthouse** ≥ 95 (PWA, Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices, SEO).
* **TTI** < 2.5s on mid‑tier mobile; **FCP** < 1.8s.
* **Search→Results**: < 700ms perceived (optimistic UI + skeletons).
* **Install rate** for PWA ≥ 10% of returning users.
* **Retention**: ≥ 2 favorites saved for 30% of users.

## Scope (Functional Requirements)

### Core Features

1. **Search locations** (debounced autosuggest) via Open‑Meteo Geocoding.
2. **Current conditions**: temp, icon (via `weather_code` mapping), location.
3. **Metrics**: feels‑like, humidity, wind, precipitation, pressure, UV, visibility.
4. **7‑day forecast**: daily hi/low, icons.
5. **Hourly view with day selector**: chart + list.
6. **Units**: global Metric/Imperial; explicit toggles for C/F, km/h|mph, mm.
7. **Responsive**: mobile‑first, tablet/desktop enhancements.
8. **Hover/focus states**: visible, accessible.

### Enhancement Features

9. **Geolocation** (first visit) with graceful deny fallback.
10. **Favorites**: add/remove; quick switch; local persistence.
11. **Compare locations**: side‑by‑side grid (2–4 locations).
12. **Sunrise/Sunset**: times + sun‑path progress visualization.
13. **Animated backgrounds**: based on condition + day/night.
14. **Voice search**: Web Speech API; fallback input.
15. **Theming**: light/dark + auto by local time; fine‑tuned palettes.
16. **PWA**: installable, offline shell, cached assets; SW update flow.

## Information Architecture & Navigation

* **Top bar**: search (with voice), units dropdown, theme toggle, favorites.
* **Hero**: current conditions card over animated background.
* **Metrics grid**: key stats cards.
* **Daily strip**: 7‑day tiles (selects the day for hourly view).
* **Hourly panel**: tabs per day (or day selector), temperature chart + scrollable list.
* **Favorites drawer**: saved locations + quick actions.
* **Compare page/section**: cards grid; each card = condensed city summary.

## UI/UX Principles

* **Clarity first**: high contrast, legible type, clean hierarchy.
* **Motion with purpose**: subtle transitions (reduced for `prefers-reduced-motion`).
* **Touch-friendly**: large hit targets, swipe where natural.
* **Keyboardable**: full tab order; visible focus; ARIA where needed.

## Milestones (MVP → Showcase)

### MVP (Week 1–2)
* Search, current, metrics, 7‑day, hourly, units, responsive, a11y baseline.

### V1 (Week 3–4)
* Geolocation, favorites, sunrise/sunset, animated backgrounds, dark/light.

### Showcase+ (Week 5)
* Compare grid, voice search, Rive hero, PWA polish, analytics.

## Acceptance Criteria (DoD)

* Meets all core requirements; passes AXE checks; Lighthouse ≥95 across categories.
* Units toggle updates all views and charts consistently.
* Day selector synchronizes hourly chart + list.
* Favorites persist; compare shows 2–4 cities with consistent layout.
* PWA installable; offline fallback works; SW update toast present.

## Open Questions

* Preferred icon set style (outlined vs filled, animated vs static)?
* Rive hero concept: abstract weather motifs vs literal scenes?
* Compare layout: max 3 or 4 cards on desktop? 2 on tablet?
* Any specific brand hue to weave into palettes?

## Risks & Mitigations

* **Geolocation denied** → default to last city or prompt search.
* **API outages** → cached last good response + error UI.
* **Voice API unsupported** → hide mic, keep keyboard search.
