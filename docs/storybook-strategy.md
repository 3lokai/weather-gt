# Storybook Strategy for Weather GT

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive Storybook strategy for the Weather GT project, including setup, component coverage, and integration with the existing development workflow.

## Storybook Integration Plan

### Phase 1: Foundations (E2-04, E2-05)
- **E2-04**: Storybook Foundations - Setup with Next.js + Vite, Tailwind v4 integration
- **E2-05**: Design Tokens & Typography Docs - MDX documentation for design system

### Phase 2: Component Documentation (E1, E2)
- Add Storybook requirements to all component stories
- Create comprehensive stories for P0 and P1 components
- Document all component states and variants

### Phase 3: Review & Regression (E7-05)
- **E7-05**: Storybook Review & Regression - Final quality gate and visual testing

## Component Coverage Matrix

### P0 Components (Must Have Complete Stories)

| Component | Stories Required | Key States |
|-----------|------------------|------------|
| **CurrentConditionsCard** | Day/night + all major WMO groups | Loading, error, different weather conditions |
| **MetricTile** | All metric types (feels-like, humidity, wind+gust, precip+PoP, pressure+trend, UV, visibility, cloud, dew) | Default, loading, error, different units |
| **DailyChip** | Hi/low, icon, PoP; selected/hover/focus | Selected, unselected, hover, focus, different weather |
| **HourlyRow + HourlyPanel** | List + chart; loading/empty/error | Loading, empty, error, different time periods |
| **UnitsDropdown** | Menu with "Switch to …" + grouped checks | Open, closed, different unit selections |
| **LocationSearch** | Empty, results, keyboard focus, error | Empty, loading, results, error, keyboard navigation |
| **ErrorState & Skeletons** | Match provided comps | Different error types, loading states |

### P1 Components (Should Have Basic Stories)

| Component | Stories Required | Key States |
|-----------|------------------|------------|
| **FavoritesDrawer** | Empty, 1–N items, reorder | Empty, populated, reordering |
| **CompareCard** | 2–4 cards grid, linked-hover demo | Different card counts, hover states |
| **SunCycle** | Progress variants | Different times of day, progress states |
| **RiveHero** | Reduced-motion off/on; clear/rain/thunder | Different weather conditions, motion preferences |

## Story Requirements

### Each Component Story Must Cover

**Themes:**
- Light mode
- Dark mode
- Condition accent themes (.theme--rain|cloudy|snow|thunder)

**Viewports:**
- Mobile (375px)
- Tablet (768px)
- Desktop (1024px+)

**States:**
- Default
- Loading
- Empty
- Error
- Disabled (where applicable)

**Units/Time:**
- Metric/Imperial units
- 12/24-hour time format

**Accessibility:**
- Focus-visible states
- High-contrast mode
- Reduced motion preferences

**Weather Conditions:**
- At least 2 WMO weather condition examples per component

## Technical Implementation

### Storybook Configuration

**Setup:**
- Next.js + Vite configuration for fast builds
- Tailwind v4 integration via app/globals.css import
- TypeScript support for all stories

**Global Decorators:**
- ThemeProvider for theme context
- QueryClientProvider with mock TanStack Query client
- Zustand store mock for global state
- Dark mode toggle via .dark class on preview root

**Add-ons:**
- @storybook/addon-essentials (docs, controls, viewport, backgrounds)
- @storybook/addon-a11y (axe accessibility testing)
- @storybook/addon-interactions (keyboard and menu flows)

```

### Design System Integration

**Color Tokens:**
- Live color swatches bound to @theme tokens
- Light and dark mode variants
- Interactive color picker for testing

**Typography:**
- Complete typography scale documentation
- Live examples with font sizes, weights, line heights
- Accessibility guidelines for text contrast

**Spacing & Radius:**
- Visual spacing scale with examples
- Border radius tokens with live preview
- Interactive playground for testing combinations

## Quality Gates

### Accessibility Compliance
- @storybook/addon-a11y shows no critical violations
- All interactive components are keyboard accessible
- Focus management works correctly
- ARIA patterns properly implemented
- Color contrast meets WCAG AA standards

### Visual Regression Testing
- Screenshot testing configured (Chromatic or similar)
- Baseline screenshots for all component states
- Cross-browser visual consistency
- Responsive design visual testing

### Documentation Quality
- All component APIs documented with controls
- Usage examples provided
- Design system integration documented
- Performance considerations noted

## Integration with Development Workflow

### Component Development
1. Create component with basic functionality
2. Add Storybook stories covering all required states
3. Test accessibility with @storybook/addon-a11y
4. Verify visual consistency across themes and viewports
5. Document component API and usage

### Design Review
- Component gallery for stakeholder review
- Interactive playground for design experimentation
- Visual regression testing for design consistency
- Accessibility compliance verification

### Quality Assurance
- Automated accessibility testing
- Visual regression testing in CI
- Cross-browser compatibility testing
- Performance impact assessment

## Dependencies

### Technical Dependencies
- **E2-01**: OKLCH Token System (must be complete)
- **E2-04**: Storybook Foundations (must be complete)
- **E2-05**: Design Tokens & Typography Docs (must be complete)
- **app/globals.css**: Tailwind v4 token definitions

### Component Dependencies
- **E1 Components**: All component stories must be implemented
- **E2 Components**: All component stories must be implemented
- **Fixture Data**: Weather and location data for realistic stories

## Success Metrics

### Coverage Metrics
- 100% of P0 components have complete stories
- 80% of P1 components have basic stories
- All stories cover required themes, viewports, and states

### Quality Metrics
- 0 critical accessibility violations
- 100% visual regression test pass rate
- All component APIs documented with controls

### Developer Experience
- Storybook builds and runs without errors
- Hot reload works for both stories and components
- Interactive playground functional for design experimentation
- Documentation comprehensive enough for new team members

## Future Enhancements

### Phase 2 Considerations
- MSW integration for realistic API mocking
- Automated screenshot testing with Chromatic
- Component performance profiling
- Design token versioning and migration tools

### Long-term Vision
- Design system as a service
- Component library distribution
- Automated design system updates
- Integration with design tools (Figma, etc.)

## Conclusion

This Storybook strategy provides a comprehensive approach to component documentation, testing, and design system management. By following this plan, the Weather GT project will have:

- Complete component documentation
- Accessibility compliance verification
- Visual regression protection
- Interactive design system documentation
- Quality gates for production readiness

The phased approach ensures that foundations are solid before building comprehensive component coverage, while the final review phase ensures production readiness.
