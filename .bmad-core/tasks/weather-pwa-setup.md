# Weather PWA Setup Task

## Overview
Guide for setting up Progressive Web App features for the weather application including offline support, installability, and service worker configuration.

## Prerequisites
- Next.js project configured
- next-pwa package installed
- PWA icons generated (192x192, 512x512)
- Basic understanding of service workers

## Implementation Steps

### 1. PWA Configuration
- Configure `next-pwa` in `next.config.js`
- Set up service worker strategies:
  - Static assets: CacheFirst
  - API calls: StaleWhileRevalidate
  - HTML: NetworkFirst with offline fallback

### 2. Manifest Setup
- Create `public/manifest.json` with proper metadata
- Configure theme colors and display modes
- Set up icon references and sizes
- Add start URL and scope

### 3. Offline Support
- Create offline page (`/offline`)
- Implement cached data display for last known location
- Add retry mechanisms for failed requests
- Show "last updated" timestamps

### 4. Service Worker Features
- Cache weather data by location
- Implement update notifications
- Handle cache invalidation on unit changes
- Add background sync for failed requests

### 5. Install Experience
- Add install prompt handling
- Implement custom install UI
- Track install events for analytics
- Handle app updates gracefully

## Performance Considerations
- Keep service worker bundle size minimal
- Use efficient caching strategies
- Implement proper cache cleanup
- Monitor storage usage

## Testing Strategy
- Test offline functionality
- Verify install prompts work
- Check update flows
- Validate cache behavior

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] App is installable on mobile and desktop
- [ ] Offline mode shows cached data
- [ ] Service worker updates work properly
- [ ] Install prompts appear appropriately
- [ ] Performance meets PWA standards
